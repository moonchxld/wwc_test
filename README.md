# Women Who Code - DC Test repository

This is a repo to test git and github workflow, that was created during the intro to OSS session
The pandemic has hindered in-person events; I hope this moment dispels soon so we can all meet up and connect!
Special Thanks to the women at #WWC who diligently plan the informing virtual events!
